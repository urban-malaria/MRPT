Can the note below the plotted map be made to speak to relevant variable selected in addition to the generic message on missing values?

It's more of an indicator. However, it is clear that it is a factor for risk assessment.
2. Rural communities have lower populations and are more likely to use the nets. High population as a factor may take the nets to communities that may not use them, and also there may not be significant net savings when nets go to wards with highest populations. The balance of population as a factor needs good attention.
