Please share your experience with how the app works.,Any other comments or suggestions to improve the app?
State Malaria Elimination Program (SMOH),Data Analyst/Scientist,Influx of people from rural areas and springing up of new communities in the urban setting with capturing them for interventions.,All new settlements should be included in the microstratification before intervention are commence or a buffer be made for emerging new communities.,"Once urban microstratification is done prior to the commencement of malaria interventions than depending on ward focal persons to provide us with information about settlement and its population, it will give us a more holistic data for better output.",I will adopt the application for SMC and LLIN campaigns ,,
State Malaria Elimination Program (SMOH),Monitoring and Evaluation officer,Acceptability of Malaria interventions in urban is somewhat challenging ,Know when and what people in Urban need,MRMT application will eliminate bias in selection process,,Stratification using the data on DHIS2 and NMDR,
State Malaria Elimination Program (SMOH),Data Analyst/Scientist,,,,i will be using,not real,i need traning on how to do it
National Malaria Elimination Programme (NMEP),"Team Lead Surveillance, M&E","Incomplete Data, Funding Constraints, Behavioral and Cultural sensitivity, improperly defined settlements classification","Strengthening collaboration to enhance data availability, improved SBC and well-tailored communication strategy to deprioritised areas, capacity building for stakeholders at all levels on a proper understanding of the process. ",Using the tool can significantly enhance the ability of NMEP to identify high-risk areas which can be given the required priority during the ITN campaign. It will show how the high-risk areas were systematically identified. The decision tree component will provide very clear guidance on how to adequately target resources,The use of the application would make the process of selection of key areas less complicated since the tool already has different components. ,"Nill. We only used ward-level shapefile obtained from INEC where TPR was overlayed to arrive at some wards to be considered for this approach. The earlier method which considered variables on housing quality, distance to water bodies, settlement classification, TPR etc was done by Prof. Ifeoma's team","Maybe after the meeting and capacity on the tool, there would be suggestions on how to improve the tool"
National Malaria Elimination Programme (NMEP),Programme Manager,"Some question the rationale
Clear methodology not appropriately communicated
Alternatives to de-prioritization of nets distribution
Community members not aware why they are being left out","Clear and early engagement with critical stakeholders starting from policy makers
Bringing out some local alternatives to nets that can easily be implemented
Getting out clear messaging for de-prioritized areas",It addresses the methodology challenge - as it tries to simplify the process,As earlier indicated it simplifies the methodology and one can use it to explain to others the process - thus ensuring easier buy-in,"We request the State to identify urban areas and where they think they can de-prioritize during the planning process. We provide a guide for this.
We review outcomes
We plot for urban areas and TPR and triangulate with outcomes of State process","If there's a connectivity issue midway you need to start afresh. Can there be a saving which can be cleared later to begin again

Input Variables Section
Legends on plotting maps to be made more explicit - easier to interpret 
Can the note below the plotted map be made to speak to relevant variable selected in addition to the generic message on missing values?

Normalization section
Drop down needed on the select variable to visualize 

Composite Score Distribution section 
It appears if you select more than two variables one is automatically disconnected from the server, and you have to start afresh.
Is there a possibility of having the explanatory note below speak to each map generated
The legend on malaria risk score is not clear "
State Ministry of Health (SMEP),Statistician,,,,For Placement of Nets during ITN Campaign and allocation resource to areas with high malaria density,Excel Dashboard developed by Benue SMEP to monitor malaria incidence in the State through case management.,non for now
State Ministry of Health (SMEP),Data Analyst/Scientist,,,"With this app, it will be very easy to select areas of DE-prioritization with the relevant data variable",,,The data variable be well defined and simplified for local use
State Ministry of Health (SMEP),M&E,,,,It clearly shows with map of area of intervention ,,
PMI Evolve Project,Programme Manager,,,,The application enables one to make informed decision on prioritization/de-prioritization of designated areas,We use VectorLink Collect which is domiciled in DHIS2 for visualizations and decision-making  ,
SMEP M&E,Monitoring evaluation Officer ,,,,The National program should review the tools accordingly and desiminate to relevant stake holders ,"Use of KOBOCOLLECT APP to carry out IMSV Visits to Secondary and tertiary health facilities and provide mentorship at service delivery point by looking at the NHMIS version 2019 data reporting tools that be a capacity building to all the health workers in the following areas:-
1. Case Management 
2. Monitoring and Evaluation 
3. Supply chain management ",Let the tool be user friendly 
State Ministry of Health (SMEP),Programme Officer,,,,I think it is a promising app that may be useful even beyond net de-prioritization. ,I am not clear about the value that the normalization tab adds to the process,"Test positivity is captured as a risk factor for malaria. It's more of an indicator. However, it is clear that it is a factor for risk assessment. Rural communities have lower populations and are more likely to use the nets. High population as a factor may take the nets to communities that may not use them, and also there may not be significant net savings when nets go to wards with highest populations. The balance of population as a factor needs good attention. Housing should be captured as ""poor housing"" to be specific as having a direct relationship with malaria."
State Ministry of Health (SMEP),Monitoring and Evaluation officer ,,,,I would adopt it because it will me deploy interventions to where they are needed,,
PATH/MACEPA,Program Specialist MEL,Quality of available data,triangulation of data to have a near to real situation estimates,The granularity of the MRMT & the potential to be strengthened as more data sources are available,The maps generated are a good starting points for decision making. It takes a lot of work off the implementers if this is adopted as the urban malaria model,,App should be updated as more data sources are available for improved decision making
Management Sciences for Health,Programme Manager,Poor data quality,,"If the data and source remain poor in quality, I think the problem will persist",It depends on my role,,More trials with real life data and data sources.
State Malaria Elimination Program (SMOH),Programme Officer,"High population density and mobility, limited data on transmission dynamics and limited resources and funding.","Utilization of innovative mapping, conduct thorough risk assessments and address potential misuses or misallocation of resources.",It will help us developed a tailored intervention toward the high population density who are prone to mosquitoes bites due to inequitable access to intervention and risk of overlooking areas with low cases,To prioritize areas with high case burden due to limited resources,,
Management Sciences for Health,Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist,Getting community level data as most available data ends at the ward level,GIS analysis,It captures all relevance data point and variable to inform decision making in de-prioritization,The model seems to have captured most relevant variables while it can be better later on,,
State Ministry of Health (SMEP),SMEOR M&E,,"Resources, and presently we are on resources mobilisation to increase funding for Malaria activities as a journey for self reliance after the exit of Development partners .

2. Poor release budgeted fund by Government to implement Malaria activities.
3. Leverage on ICCM/CHIPs program by using CORPs ",Malaria Cases are high due seasonality ,I am ready to use App always ,Very interesting ,Advanced training on how to develop an electronic data Collection tools
