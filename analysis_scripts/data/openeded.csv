openended
Influx of people from rural areas and springing up of new communities in the urban setting with capturing them for interventions.
Acceptability of Malaria interventions in urban is somewhat challenging 
"Incomplete Data, Funding Constraints, Behavioral and Cultural sensitivity, improperly defined settlements classification"
Some question the rational. Clear methodology not appropriately communicated. Alternatives to de-prioritization of nets distribution. Community members not aware why they are being left out
Quality of available data
Poor data quality
"High population density and mobility, limited data on transmission dynamics and limited resources and funding."
Getting community level data as most available data ends at the ward level
All new settlements should be included in the microstratification before intervention are commence or a buffer be made for emerging new communities.
Know when and what people in Urban need
"Strengthening collaboration to enhance data availability, improved SBC and well-tailored communication strategy to deprioritised areas, capacity building for stakeholders at all levels on a proper understanding of the process. "
Clear and early engagement with critical stakeholders starting from policy makers. Bringing out some local alternatives to nets that can easily be implemented. Getting out clear messaging for de-prioritized areas
triangulation of data to have a near to real situation estimates
"Utilization of innovative mapping, conduct thorough risk assessments and address potential misuses or misallocation of resources."
"Resources, and presently we are on resources mobilisation to increase funding for Malaria activities as a journey for self reliance after the exit of Development partners . Poor release budgeted fund by Government to implement Malaria activities. Leverage on ICCM/CHIPs program by using CORPs "
"Once urban microstratification is done prior to the commencement of malaria interventions than depending on ward focal persons to provide us with information about settlement and its population, it will give us a more holistic data for better output."
MRMT application will eliminate bias in selection process
Using the tool can significantly enhance the ability of NMEP to identify high-risk areas which can be given the required priority during the ITN campaign. It will show how the high-risk areas were systematically identified. The decision tree component will provide very clear guidance on how to adequately target resources
It addresses the methodology challenge - as it tries to simplify the process
"With this app, it will be very easy to select areas of DE-prioritization with the relevant data variable"
The granularity of the MRMT & the potential to be strengthened as more data sources are available
"If the data and source remain poor in quality, I think the problem will persist"
It will help us developed a tailored intervention toward the high population density who are prone to mosquitoes bites due to inequitable access to intervention and risk of overlooking areas with low cases
It captures all relevance data point and variable to inform decision making in de-prioritization
Malaria Cases are high due seasonality 
"State Malaria Elimination Program, Monitoring and Evaluation Officer."
The end user will be NMEP SMEOR/IVM Branch in addition to other key branches and malaria partners. 
"I can use the app, and I want each technical colleague in the SMEOR and IVM unit to be able to use. I want to see SMEP PM and M&E being able to use the app"
"I will, if its needed but I think its mainly a national governmental program tool in this respect"
"Yes, the team will surely put it along other tools to put into consideration in decision making"
ease 
I will adopt the application for SMC and LLIN campaigns 
i will be using
The use of the application would make the process of selection of key areas less complicated since the tool already has different components. 
As earlier indicated it simplifies the methodology and one can use it to explain to others the process - thus ensuring easier buy-in
For Placement of Nets during ITN Campaign and allocation resource to areas with high malaria density
None
It clearly shows with map of area of intervention 
The application enables one to make informed decision on prioritization/de-prioritization of designated areas
The National program should review the tools accordingly and desiminate to relevant stake holders 
I think it is a promising app that may be useful even beyond net de-prioritization. 
I would adopt it because it will me deploy interventions to where they are needed
The maps generated are a good starting points for decision making. It takes a lot of work off the implementers if this is adopted as the urban malaria model
It depends on my role
To prioritize areas with high case burden due to limited resources
The model seems to have captured most relevant variables while it can be better later on
I am ready to use App always 
None
Stratification using the data on DHIS2 and NMDR
not real
"Nill. We only used ward-level shapefile obtained from INEC where TPR was overlayed to arrive at some wards to be considered for this approach. The earlier method which considered variables on housing quality, distance to water bodies, settlement classification, TPR etc was done by Prof. Ifeoma's team"
"We request the State to identify urban areas and where they think they can de-prioritize during the planning process. We provide a guide for this.
We review outcomes
We plot for urban areas and TPR and triangulate with outcomes of State process"
Excel Dashboard developed by Benue SMEP to monitor malaria incidence in the State through case management.
None
We use VectorLink Collect which is domiciled in DHIS2 for visualizations and decision-making  
"Use of KOBOCOLLECT APP to carry out IMSV Visits to Secondary and tertiary health facilities and provide mentorship at service delivery point by looking at the NHMIS version 2019 data reporting tools that be a capacity building to all the health workers in the following areas, Case Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, Supply chain management "
I am not clear about the value that the normalization tab adds to the process
Very interesting 
i need traning on how to do it
"Maybe after the meeting and capacity on the tool, there would be suggestions on how to improve the tool"
"If there's a connectivity issue midway you need to start afresh. Can there be a saving which can be cleared later to begin again. Legends on plotting maps to be made more explicit - easier to interpret. Can the note below the plotted map be made to speak to relevant variable selected in addition to the generic message on missing values? Drop down needed on the select variable to visualize.  It appears if you select more than two variables one is automatically disconnected from the server, and you have to start afresh. Is there a possibility of having the explanatory note below speak to each map generated. The legend on malaria risk score is not clear "
The data variable be well defined and simplified for local use
Let the tool be user friendly 
"Test positivity is captured as a risk factor for malaria. It's more of an indicator. However, it is clear that it is a factor for risk assessment.  Rural communities have lower populations and are more likely to use the nets. High population as a factor may take the nets to communities that may not use them, and also there may not be significant net savings when nets go to wards with highest populations. The balance of population as a factor needs good attention. Housing should be captured as ""poor housing"" to be specific as having a direct relationship with malaria."
App should be updated as more data sources are available for improved decision making
More trials with real life data and data sources.
